# Minimum Assertion Baseline

Every proposal test MUST include meaningful assertions in both `_beforeProposal()` and `_afterExecution()`. Passing execution alone is not sufficient — assertions prove the proposal achieves its stated intent and does not silently mis-configure state.

## `_beforeProposal()` — capture and verify pre-state

At minimum:

1. **Snapshot values that will change.** Store balances, owners, config values, or permissions into state variables so `_afterExecution()` can compare against them.
2. **Assert preconditions hold.** If the proposal assumes the timelock owns a contract, assert that. If it assumes a permission does NOT exist yet, assert that too. This catches stale fork blocks or incorrect assumptions.
3. **For permission proposals:** exercise permissions that will be revoked (they should succeed) and attempt permissions that will be added (they should revert). This creates a before/after proof.

## `_afterExecution()` — verify every claimed effect

At minimum, assert **one check per executable call** in the proposal. The categories below are not exhaustive but cover the most common proposal types:

| Proposal type | Required assertions |
|---------------|---------------------|
| **Token transfer** | Recipient balance increased by exact amount. Sender balance decreased by exact amount (or at least changed). Use `assertEq` on the delta, not just `assertNotEq`. |
| **Ownership / registry change** | New owner or registry value matches expected address. Old value no longer applies. |
| **Permission grant (Zodiac Roles, access control)** | The granted action succeeds when executed by the authorized actor. A similar action with wrong parameters reverts (negative test). |
| **Permission revocation** | The revoked action reverts with the expected error selector. |
| **Configuration change** (flow rates, parameters, upgrades) | New config value matches expected. Old value no longer returned. |
| **Contract deployment / upgrade** | New contract address is non-zero. Key interface calls return expected values (e.g., `owner()`, `version()`). |
| **ENS name operations** | `ensRegistry.owner(namehash(...))` or resolver returns expected value. |

## Anti-patterns to avoid

- **Empty hooks.** `_beforeProposal() {}` or `_afterExecution() {}` is never acceptable for a review to be published.
- **Only `assertNotEq`.** This proves something changed but not that it changed correctly. Always pair with an `assertEq` on the expected value.
- **No negative tests for permission changes.** If a proposal grants scoped permissions, test that out-of-scope parameters revert. If it revokes permissions, test that the revoked action fails.

These assertions carry forward from pre-draft through draft to live stages. Writing them early saves rework later.
